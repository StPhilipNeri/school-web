St. Philip Neri Primary School is situated in Joska, approximately 4 km off Kangundo road. His Excellency Michal Mlynar, Slovak ambassador to Kenya, officially opened the school on 14th January 2013. It is a day and boarding school supporting former street children, orphans and vulnerable children by providing free pre school and primary education to children from disadvantaged families. It has a capacity of 450 children including 250 borders. 

The main objective of the school is to provide a **free primary education for the vulnerable and enhance the sense of belonging among the more fortune members of society.**

Currently we have 350 pupils both borders and day scholars from which 90% are fully sponsored.

## History
We have a great experience to work with former street boys and girls coming from the streets of Nairobi. Some of our children admitted in our partners` rehabilitation centers in 2007 are currently high school students in well known national schools like Maranda High school,Starehe Girls Secondary School,St.Marys Yala just to name but a few.

The idea of St. Philip Neri Primary School came as an impulse of the Millennium development Goals and Vision Kenya 2030 "free primary education for all the children" including orphans and vulnerable.

The school was constructed through Slovak aid project and St. Elizabeth University College, Slovakia in 2012.

## Partners
The main partners are: St. Kizito Children Centre in Mihango, Nairobi, St. Elizabeth University College in Slovakia and Dobrota pre Afriku in Slovakia.

## Programs

### 1. Support of street children
Our main partner in Kenya  is St. Kizito Children Centre based in Mihango that focus on rehabilitation of street children and their reintegration back to community. After 2 years of successful rehabilitation the children are ready to be reintegrated. Having in mind their background and problematic families, the children are based suitable for boarding education where they can focus only on education and dysfunctional families do not disturb them. All the children from St. Kizito Children Centre, both boys and girls, are sent to St. Philip Neri Primary School where they study for free thanks to sponsors.

### 2. Bright and needy program
The idea of bright and needy program came in the end of 2013 whereby the school decided to expand their sponsorship to bright but needy children in the community. The sponsorship is based on the previous 2 years academic performance and the pupils must continue to score the target grades all throughout the sponsored period. 

### 3. Free pre school education 
The pre school education is fully sponsored for each child in order to support the community from low developed area of Joska village and Muthwani area. The pre school system starts from baby class and it's based on Montessori system.
